		discussion was the capability of cloud competing to store and process their data in third party data centres.
		The speakers mainly talked about how cloud computing allows companies to avoid upfront infrastructure 
		costs, and focus on projects that differentiate their business. Also a major advantage that was showcased by 
		the workshop was how it pumped up the speed of applications and improved manageability with less 
		maintenance. It demonstrated an example of how cloud technology works as an efficient system to improve quality service 
		to reduce overhead costs, downtime and automate infrastructure deployment.</p>

		The Laptop Controlled Bot: This Bot can be controlled using a laptop which is connected to the Bot 
		through a USB cable. The arrow keys provide the required navigation for the Bot.
		The Joystick Controlled Bot: This bot can be controlled using a joystick which is also called the 
		accelerometer. The joystick can be programmed to control the speed and the extent to which the joystick 
		can be pushed to accelerate.
		The Gesture Controlled Bot:This bot can be controlled using human gestures. It uses an accelerometer to

		<p class="black-text">Live Angry Birds was a fun, new and enthralling event conducted for the first time by ISTE in Riviera’16. 
		This event was an attempt to bring the famous mobile game, ‘Angry Birds’ to life. In this event, two huge 
		catapults were made for the event, which amplified the feel of playing the Angry Birds live. This event 
		involved providing the participants with various goods like boxes and balloons having different points with 
		which they were supposed to build their own little arena in a confined area. The boxes were painted in 
		different colors and there were certain points for each color. Participants played in teams of two and showed 
		their skills and strength in the real world of gaming by destroying the arena set up by the opponent team with 
		the help of catapults. The team that scored the maximum points won. The event received a good response from the masses.</p>

		<p class="black-text">Prison Break was a 2 day event conducted by ISTE that is inspired by various detective series and 
		movies.The event consisted of 10 rounds where participants were challenged to think on their feet and solve 
		intricate ciphers. The event basically involved a team of two, one person being inside the prison and the 
		other, working outside to prove him innocent.
		The plot opened up after every round.The event had two major parts, solving ciphersand performing tasks 
		within the campus. In every round, one person stayed inside the prison and solved ciphers to reveal the next 
		part of the story and the other person performed tasks like solving clues to get to a location in order to get 
		the next cipher. After every round, the person inside the prison went outside and vice versa.</p>

		<h4><center>Human Foosball</h4><hr>
		<p class="black-text">Human Foosball was the most popular, enthralling and exciting informal event that was conducted by ISTE. 
		It was conducted on all four days of Riviera every year. In this event, instead of playing foosball on a table, 
		participants had to physically compete in an arena replacing the tiny plastic players, as the name suggests. 
		The arena was built exactly like in the game ‘foosball’ but, of course larger in size and compatible for 10 
		people entering the arena. Participants played in teams of 5 and the main aim was to score as many goals as possible and for the 
		winning team to have as high a score difference as possible.p</p>
